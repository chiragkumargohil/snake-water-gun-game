# snake-water-gun-game

Snake Water Gun is one of the famous two-player game. The rules of the game are as follows:
	1) Snake vs. Water: Snake drinks the water hence wins,
	2) Water vs. Gun: The gun will drown in water, hence a point for water,
	3) Gun vs. Snake: Gun will kill the snake and win, 
	4) In situations where both players choose the same object, the result will be a draw.

I have created this game using Python. So, let's play...
